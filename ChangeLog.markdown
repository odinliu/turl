# Odichy Turl ChangeLog #

## 1.0 Initial Release - Feb.11 2010 ##

In this version, we complete a basic algorithm of generating short urls.
But in 64 characters version, '-' and '_' is strange in urls. So we need
to find out a new algorithm which can generate short urls only by using
lower letter 'a' to 'z', upper letter 'A' to 'Z' and digits '0' to '9'.
There are 62 characters in total.
